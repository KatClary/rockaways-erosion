<p>Significant erosion forces beach closures because there aren't safe spaces for the community to congregate on the eroded beach. In the Rockaways, this leads to a lack of lifeguards on duty. Although the public is prohibited from swimming in these sections when the beach is closed, the city has been unable to stop curious people from entering the closed beaches, and drownings happen frequently. In 2019, seven people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/nyregion/rockaway-beach-drownings.html">drowned</a> in the Rockaways. (Source: New York Times)

<p>Sand dunes create significant barriers that help protect the shoreline during storms, and also protect communities from waves and flooding during storms. When erosion withers away dunes, communities are more vulnerable â€“ and the beach will be even more susceptible to sand loss.

<p>The beach and its dunes are a delicate ecosystem for hundreds of New York wildlife species; dunes contain valuable plants that benefit pollinators, birds, and bats. When we lose the dunes due to erosion, we lose our most precious wild animals. Dunes are also safehavens for birds, who nest and rest in the foliage. (Source: Jamaica Bay-Rockaway Parks Conservancy)
