  <h1>Erosion in the Rockaways is Happening, and it's Affecting More than Just the Beach</h1>

<p>Have you ever thought about what a day at the beach would be like without sand? It sounds unusual, but it's actually happening. Erosion is when sand gradually disappears from our shorelines due to storms, lack of infrastructure, and various man-made causes. When our beaches erode, it doesn't just make for a bad beach day. It effects many aspects of an otherwise functioning community. Below, I've outlined some of the biggest risks we face when we cannot combat erosion.

<p>Significant erosion forces beach closures because there aren't safe spaces for the community to congregate on the eroded beach. In the Rockaways, this leads to a lack of lifeguards on duty. Although the public is prohibited from swimming in these sections when the beach is closed, the city has been unable to stop curious people from entering the closed beaches, and drownings happen frequently. In 2019, seven people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/nyregion/rockaway-beach-drownings.html">drowned</a> in the Rockaways. (Source: New York Times)

<p>Sand dunes create significant barriers that help protect the shoreline and nearby communities during storms. They're physically capable of preventing large waves from entering land. When erosion withers away dunes, communities are more vulnerable â€“ and the beach will be even more susceptible to sand loss. (Source: University of Connecticut)

<p>The beach and its dunes are a delicate ecosystem for hundreds of New York wildlife species; dunes contain valuable plants that benefit pollinators, birds, and bats. When we lose the dunes due to erosion, we lose our most precious wild animals. Dunes are also safehavens for birds, who nest and rest in the foliage. (Source: Jamaica Bay-Rockaway Parks Conservancy)

<p>Sand dunes also serve as important storage units of sand when the beach runs out of the precious natural material. Instead of dredging offshore or using expensive methods of transporting sand to the beach, the dunes contain the sand we need. With erosion, this beneficial resource is removed from the equation.
